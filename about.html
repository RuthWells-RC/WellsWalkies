        <h1>Your Dog's New Best Friend</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Wells, and I've dedicated my life to making dogs happy. With
          over 7 years of professional experience and a genuine passion for
          animal welfare, I treat every dog like my own family member.

      <!-- Personal Story Section -->

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up, I always had dogs in my family. From my childhood Golden
          Retriever, Buddy, to the rescue Beagle mix I adopted in college, dogs
          have been my constant companions and greatest teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working in corporate environments for several years, I realized
          my true calling was working with animals. I started volunteering at
          local shelters, which opened my eyes to the incredible need for
          quality pet care services in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wells Walkies was born from a simple belief: every dog deserves
          individual attention, exercise, and love, especially when their humans
          can't be there. I've built this business on trust, reliability, and
          genuine care for each four-legged client.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not walking dogs, you can find me hiking local trails,
          reading about animal behavior, or volunteering at weekend adoption
          events. I currently share my home with two rescue dogs, Luna and
          Charlie, who keep me on my toes and remind me daily why I love this
          work so much.
